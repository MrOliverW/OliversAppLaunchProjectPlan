Potential Risks:
Some of the project risks include not completing the tasks in time for the official soft launch and not meeting the release date. There is also the risk of miscalculating the amount of resources it will take to complete the app with regard to manpower and computing resources. There is also a risk of a competitor stealing our ideas if we decide to go open source. We will meet 2 times a week to ensure our work is being done on time and use email and a project management software board to stay on track. 
Success Metrics:
Our project is successful once we have a bug-free, user-friendly app which is loved by our userbase and beneficial to their lives. Reaching 1,000 active users will serve as a huge milestone that we are succeeding in our efforts.
